# Side Bar Enhancements

## Description

Sidebar menu for Sublime Text. This Package notably provides

- delete as "move to trash",
- a clipboard, and
- files affected by a rename/move command are closed, renamed/moved, and re-opened again.

## Default Menu Items

SideBarEnhancements' `Side Bar.sublime-menu` context menu resource file is designed to
fully replace both the `Side Bar.sublime-menu` and `Side Bar Mount Point.sublime-menu` context menus from the `Default` Package.  When you are ready to do so, you can suppress
the appearance of the menu items from these two `Default` context menus by creating
these two empty files in your `<data_path>/Packages/Default/` directory.  If the
`<data_path>/Packages/Default/` directory does not already exist, you can create it
with the help of "Preferences -> Browse Packages".

- `<data_path>/Packages/Default/Side Bar Mount Point.sublime-menu`
- `<data_path>/Packages/Default/Side Bar.sublime-menu`
