# Side Bar Enhancements
[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/CodeByZach/sublime_side_bar_enhancements.svg?label=version)](https://github.com/CodeByZach/sublime_side_bar_enhancements/releases)

## Description

Provides enhancements to the operations on Side Bar of Files and Folders for [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com).

Notably provides delete as "move to trash", open with.. and a clipboard.

Close, move, open and restore buffers affected by a rename/move command. (even on folders)

New file/folder, edit, open/run, reveal, find in selected/parent/project, cut, copy, paste, paste in parent, rename, move, delete, refresh....

Copy paths as URIs, URLs, content as UTF8, content as <data:uri> base64 ( nice for embedding into CSS! ), copy as tags img/a/script/style, duplicate

Preference to control if a buffer should be closed when affected by a deletion operation.

Allows to display "file modified date" and "file size" on statusbar (may be a bit buggy).

To get rid of the stock ST menuitems create two empty files on "Preferences -> Browse Packages"

- `Default/Side Bar Mount Point.sublime-menu`
- `Default/Side Bar.sublime-menu`

## Installation

Download or clone the contents of this repository to a folder named exactly as the package name into the Packages/ folder of ST.

Troubleshooting Installation:

- First please note this package only adds a context menu to the "Folders" section and not to the "Open Files" section.
- Open the package folder. Main menu -\> Preferences -\> Browse Packages.
- Close Sublime Text.
- Remove the folder "Packages/SideBarEnhancements"
- Remove the folder "User/SideBarEnhancements"
- Navigate one folder up, to "Installed Packages/", check for any instance of SideBarEnhancements and remove it.
- Open ST, with Package Control go to : Remove Package, check for any instance of SideBarEnhancements and remove it.
- Restart ST
- Open ST, check if there is any entry about SideBarEnhancements in Package Control(in sections: "Remove Package" and just in case in "Enable Package")
- Repeat until you find there no entry about SideBarEnhancements
- Restart ST
- Install it.
- It works

## F12 key

(Please note that from version 2.122104 this package no longer provides the key, you need to manually add it to your sublime-keymap file (see next section))

F12 key allows you to open the current file in browser.

`url_testing` allows you to set the url of your local server, opened via F12

`url_production` allows you to set the url of your production server, opened via ALT+F12

### With absolute paths

- Right click any file on the Side Bar and select: "Project -\> Edit Projects Preview URLs"
- Edit this file, and add your paths and URLs with the following structure:

<!-- -->
    {
        "S:/www/domain.tld":{
            "url_testing":"http://testing",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld"
        },
        "C:/Users/luna/some/domain2.tld":{
            "url_testing":"http://testing1",
            "url_production":"http://productiontld2"
        }
    }

### With relative paths

Imagine we have a project with the following structure

    Project/ < - root project folder
    Project/libs/
    Project/public/ < - the folder we want to load as "http://localhost/"
    Project/private/
    Project/experimental/ < - other folder we may run as experimental/test in another url "http://experimental/"

Then we create configuration file:

`Project/.sublime/SideBarEnhancements.json`

with content:

    {
        "public/":{
            "url_testing":"http://localhost/",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
        },
        "experimental/":{
            "url_testing":"http://experimental/",
            "url_production":"http://domain.tld/"
        },
        "":{
            "url_testing":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/",
            "url_production":"http://the_url_for_the_project_root/"
        }
    }

You can create config files `some/folder/.sublime/SideBarEnhancements.json` anywhere.

#### F12 key conflict

On Sublime Text 3 `F12` key is bound to `"goto_definition"` command by default. This package was conflicting with that key, this no longers happens. You need to manually add the keys now, go to:
`Preferences -> Package Settings -> Side Bar -> Key Bindings - User`
and add any of the following:

    [
        { "keys": ["f12"],
            "command": "side_bar_open_in_browser" ,
            "args":{"paths":[], "type":"testing", "browser":""}
        },
        { "keys": ["alt+f12"],
            "command": "side_bar_open_in_browser",
            "args":{"paths":[], "type":"production", "browser":""}
        },
        {
            "keys": ["ctrl+t"],
            "command": "side_bar_new_file2"
        },
        {
            "keys": ["f2"],
            "command": "side_bar_rename"
        },
    ]

## Keybinding for Find in paths:

You may wish to add a key for opening "find in paths.."

    [
        {
            "keys": ["f10"],
            "id": "side-bar-find-files",
            "command": "side_bar_find_files_path_containing",
            "args": {
                "paths": []
            }
        }
    ]


## Notes on configuring the `Open With` menu:

Definitions file: `User/SideBarEnhancements/Open With/Side Bar.sublime-menu` (note the extra subfolder levels). To open it, right-click on any file in an open project and select `Open With > Edit Applications...`

- On macOS, the 'application' property simply takes the _name_ of an application, to which the file at hand's full path will be passed as if with `open ...`, e.g.: "application": "Google Chrome"
- On macOS, invoking _shell_ commands is NOT supported.
- You should change Caption and id of the menu item to be unique.

<!-- -->
    {
        "caption": "Photoshop",
        "id": "side-bar-files-open-with-photoshop",
        "command": "side_bar_files_open_with",
        "args": {
            "paths": [],
            "application": "Adobe Photoshop CS5.app", // macOS
            "extensions": "psd|png|jpg|jpeg",  // Any file with these extensions
            "multiple": true,
            "args": []
        }
    },

### Vars on "args" param

- \$PATH - The full path to the current file, "C:\Files\Chapter1.txt"
- \$PROJECT - The root directory of the current project.
- \$DIRNAME - The directory of the current file, "C:\Files"
- \$NAME - The name portion of the current file, "Chapter1.txt"
- \$NAME_NO_EXTENSION - The name portion of the current file without the extension, "Chapter1"
- \$EXTENSION - The extension portion of the current file, "txt"
